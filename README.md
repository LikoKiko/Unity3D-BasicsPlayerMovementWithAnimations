# Player Movement in Unity
This project is a demonstration of player movement in a 3D environment using Unity. It includes walking, running, jumping, and attacking functionalities. The player character’s movements are controlled using both keyboard inputs and mouse movements.

## Features
 - Walking and Running: The player can move in any direction using the ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘S’, and ‘D’ keys. Holding down the left shift key while moving will make the player run.
 - Jumping: The player can jump by pressing the space bar. The jump includes three stages: preparation, the actual jump, and landing. Each stage has its own animation.
 - Attacking: The player can attack by clicking the left mouse button. An attack animation is played when the attack occurs.
 - Camera Rotation: The camera follows the player and also responds to mouse movements, providing a smooth and immersive gameplay experience.
 - Animations: The player character has animations for different actions like walking, running, jumping, and attacking. These animations are controlled using Unity’s Animator component.

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand player movement and camera control in Unity. It provides a solid foundation that can be expanded upon to create more complex and interactive 3D games.


## Note
The character design and animations are not originally mine. I only added the jump animation, player movement, and map. The rest of the assets were obtained from other sources.
